## Features

- üì¶ Install shadcn-compatible components from multiple UI libraries
- ‚ö° Fast, zero-config CLI
- üõ†Ô∏è Supports libraries like magic-ui, aceternity-ui, hexta-ui, kib-ui, and more
- üß© Extensible registry system
- üìù TypeScript support

---

## Usage

1. First initalize `dotcn` in your project.

```bash
pnpm dlx dotcn@latest init .
# optionally you can specify a directory using -c or --cwd, by default it uses current directory.
# NOTE make sure that you initialize dotcn in the same directory as shadcn,
```
2. Now you can add registries such as magic-ui aceternity-ui etc...
For that you need two things
1. name of registry
2. url of that registry where it's components are hosted.
```bash
pnpm dlx dotcn@latest registries add magic-ui https://magicui.design/r/
```
3. Now you can add any component from magic-ui by just mentioning it's name,
```bash
pnpm dlx dotcn@latest add magic-ui marquee # adds the marquee component from magic-ui
```
You no longer have to remember all that long urls, just add any registry and then install it like `dotcn add <registry> <component>`
